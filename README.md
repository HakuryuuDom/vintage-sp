## Introduction

 [TL;DR.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7zPlQjAr8) *Simulates skills client-side, eliminating ping-based delays and animation lock.*

**Does this mean my ping will effectively be lower?** 

No. What the module does is attempt to avoid the restraints caused by ping on skills, letting the player interact with skills in the intended way. Please do remember that skill emulation isn't perfect (nor can it ever be due to the lack of server side support) and the module's accuracy is heavily affected by the user's **network quality, natural ping and fps stability**.

**What about PvP, does it work with no affairs?** 

Oh, of course. It works perfectly well for PvP if you type '/8 sp off' in chat. **The answer is and always will be no. Stop using SP for PvP purposes.**

**Notes:**

* It can get you banned due to possible desync and further users report. Use at own risk.

## Installation

1. Download the module via clicking in the button `Clone or Download` and then on `Download Zip`.
2. Uncompress and place the resulting folder in `tera-proxy\mods` and you're set.
3. Make sure that Windows Game mode isn't enabled since it can delay the proxy and thus the skills and everything else.

**Notes:**

* This module requires **Caali's proxy**. It can be found on his [discord server](https://discord.gg/dUNDDtw).

## Usage

Refer to docs in the module folder. If you can't make anything out of it, just go in-game, wait for a while, and do '/8 sp config generate' and follow it up with '/8 sp config save'.

**P.S.** If you like this, please consider sliding into Salty's DMs and buying nextgen SP. It's exponentially better and frequently updated by people who know what they're doing. I'm only maintaining this for friends who can't afford to spend $30 or people still undecided on purchasing nextgen. You can consider this a free trial for as long as I can keep it up.
